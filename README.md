##### Second Order Linear Equations
given the following assumptions:

$ax^2+bx+c$ $\Delta = b^2 - 4ac, for:$
1) $\Delta > 0 :$ we have two solutions in $\R$
2) $\Delta = 0 :$ we have two solutions (same point) in $\R$
3) $\Delta < 0 :$ we have two solutions in $\Complex$. No solution in $\R$

Main formula, with $\Delta>=0$: $$x{_1,_2}=\frac{-b - \sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}$$

##### Notable products
1) $(a-b)^2 = a^2+2ab+b^2$ 
2) $(a+b+c)^2 = a^2+b^2+2ab+2ac+2bc$
   $(a-b+c)^2 = a^2+b^2-2ab+2ac-2bc$
3) $(a+b)^3 = a^3+3a^2b+3a^b2+b^3$
   $(a-b)^3 = a^3-3a^2b+3a^b2-b^3$
4) $a^2-b^2 = (a-b)(a+b)$
5) $a^3+b^3 = (a+b)(a^2-ab+b^2)$
   $a^3-b^3 = (a-b)(a^2+ab+b^2)$

#####Third order or more linear equations
If no notable product is found, than we can **try** to apply the *Ruffini Method*. We shall have at end of the process:

  $$P(x)=(x-a)Q(x)$$ with $Q(x)$ as a polinome with $P(x)$-1 order.

1) We need to calculate $f(x)$ substituting $x$ with each divisor of $c$ until we take the result 0 (satisfied equation).
2) When found, apply the matrix method (see a reference). The result **must be** 0 for the known term.
3) Write the result in the given form and try to apply the method again (but first, see if you have a *notable product*).

##### Logarithms properties
1) $a^{\log{_a}{b}} = b$ (definition)
2) $\log{_a}{b^c} = c\log{_a}{b}$ (Exponent)
3) $\log{_a}{bc} = \log{_a}{b}+\log{_a}{c}$ (Product)
4) $\log{_a}{\frac{b}{c}} = \log{_a}{b}-\log{_a}{c}$ (Quotient)
5) $\log{_a}{b} = \frac{\log{_c}{b}}{\log{_c}{a}}$ (Base conversion)
6) $\log{_a}{b} = \frac{1}{\log{_b}{a}}$ (Inversion)

##### Limits

If $f(x)$ is defined and continuous in the limit segment we want to calculate, than we can proceed.
